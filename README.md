# ASCII Art Converter

## Introduction
This script converts images into ASCII art. It's a simple Python tool that takes an image file as input and outputs a representation of that image using ASCII characters.

## Requirements
- Python (3.x recommended)
- PIL (Python Imaging Library), also known as Pillow

## Installation
1. **Install Python**: If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Install PIL/Pillow**: You can install the Pillow library, which is an updated fork of PIL, using pip. Open your command line and run:
   ```
   pip install Pillow
   ```

## Usage
1. **Run the Script**: Open your command line interface and navigate to the folder containing the `ascii_art_converter.py` script. Run the script using:
   ```
   python ascii_art_converter.py
   ```

2. **Enter Image Path**: When prompted, enter the full path to the image file you want to convert.

3. **View ASCII Art**: The script will display the ASCII art in the command line window.

## Example
- Input: `path/to/image.jpg`
- Output: ASCII art representation of the image displayed in the console.
